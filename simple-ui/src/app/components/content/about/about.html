            <h1>Hello world</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a Full-Stack Developer with 4+ years of experience building 
                enterprise-scale applications using Java Spring Boot, Angular, and SQL. 
                I'm passionate about writing clean, scalable code and designing solutions 
                that make complex processes simple. I enjoy collaborating across teams, 
                turning ideas into reliable products, and continuously learning new 
                technologies to sharpen my craft. My goal is to build software that not 
                only performs well – but truly makes a difference for the people who use it.
